  Hi, my name is Jason and I'm a Phd student in Graphics and Machine learning. 
  I have a double master degree in Informatics and Telecommunications network from INSA (France) and Graphics in Seoul National University (South Korea).
  My research mainly focus on Reinforcement Learning for motion of characters, and I am interested in exploring new fields of application for machine learning !

		Thesis on contact planning for humanoid locomotion in the [MEMMO](https://www.memmo-project.eu/) project.
		I worked on a RL steering method, with a terrain-aware navigation skills, generating a robot root trajectory before contact planning.
